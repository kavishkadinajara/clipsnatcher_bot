# Security Policy

## Overview

This security policy outlines the steps and measures taken to protect sensitive information and maintain the security of the Video Downloader Bot project. It also provides guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities and contributing securely to the project.

## Supported Versions

We maintain security updates for the following versions:

- **Latest Release**: Active security support.
- **Previous Release**: Security support until the next release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the project, please do the following:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue**: Avoid discussing the vulnerability publicly to prevent potential exploitation.
2. **Contact Us Directly**: Email the security team at [kastbus@gmail.com] with the details of the vulnerability. Please include:
   - A description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact.
   - Suggested mitigations or fixes.

We will respond to the issue within 48 hours and work with you to confirm and resolve the vulnerability. We may also ask for additional information or clarification.

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, follow these best practices:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - **Never Hardcode Secrets**: Ensure that sensitive information such as API tokens, credentials, and private keys are stored in environment variables, not in the source code.
   - **Use `.env` Files**: Store environment variables in a `.env` file and make sure this file is excluded from version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.

2. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - Use GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information in GitHub Actions workflows.
   - Never expose secrets directly in logs, commits, or issues.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to ensure the project remains secure against known vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.

4. **Code Reviews**:
   - All contributions must go through a thorough code review process to identify potential security issues.
   - Look out for insecure coding practices, such as insufficient validation of user inputs, outdated dependencies, and improper error handling.

## Handling Sensitive Data

- **Sensitive Files**:
   - Ensure that files containing sensitive information (e.g., `.env` files, private keys) are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being accidentally committed.
  
- **Token Management**:
   - Regularly rotate API tokens and secrets, and limit their scope to the minimum required permissions.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the reported issue before publicizing it. We are committed to working with the community to ensure the security of this project.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank anyone who reports security issues and helps us improve the security of this project. Your efforts are greatly appreciated.
